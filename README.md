# MINOS Analysis

## Introduction

The Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) experiment was first proposed in 1998 following results from experiments such as the Super-Kamiokande. It aimed to conduct a high-sensitivity search of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations at the atmospheric scale and probe the oscillation parameter space. The experiment was carried out by the MINOS collaboration at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL or Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois. Neutrinos from either NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) or the atmosphere were detected at the Near Detector (ND) and the Far Detector (FD). This dual-detector design allowed for comparisons of neutrino interaction topology and energy deposition patterns between the ND and FD, which made it possible to infer changes in the flavour flux of neutrinos travelling through matter; allowing the search for oscillations. The MINOS experiment ran from 2005 to 2012. It was upgraded to MINOS+ and continued from 2012 to 2016 when it was finally shut down.
